          <h3>Design a game with us</h3>
          <p class="small">Located at our studio in the heart of Madison, WI, each game design fellowship is a pop-up community that makes space for creating something totally new. You’ll come out for an overnight or two and join our design team.</p>
          <p>Each event brings together an uncommon collection of artists, educators, subject experts, and designers. As an expert educator, you’ll do game design side-by-side with other experts, like underwater archaeologists, biologists, or archivists.</p>

          <h3>A new kind of Workshop</h3>
          <p class="small">Our teacher fellowships are boutique events—not normal PD workshops—that are carefully crafted to inspire you. Each event mixes the best of talks, design, tours, and inspiration like art, music and game playing. .</p>
          <p>We’ll start with a cozy get-together, where we’ll sip drinks and chat.  Then we’ll transition into two days of learning, inspiration, and design. After the event, stay connected with online meet-ups, plus a few ways to get kids involved in design work. We’ll end up with a brand new game that will reach kids across the world.</p>
          <p>We offer four fellowships each year. Join us! </p>

            <p class="small">You’ll have your students play the game in class and share their opinions. Kids love getting behind the scenes and seeing the game in different stages of development. Their feedback will help inform the final version of the game.  </p>

            <h3>We think so! </h3>
            <p class="small" >This process can be very inspiring for career inspiration and critical thinking. When kids see behind the scenes of how a game is made, it opens their eyes to the details of the design process. Some kids get a vision for becoming a designer or maker. Other kids learn about the subject experts who work on the project and realize new career options they had never imagined (like Underwater Archaeologist!). Plus kids we work with love seeing how their input get implemented into the designs. Its super empowering for them.</p>

We give priority to teachers who have come to past fellowships. More than anything, we want to build a community of like minded educators to inspire us and each other.
