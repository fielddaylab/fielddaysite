          <h3>We'll design a game together</h3>
          <p class="small">Located at our studio in the heart of Madison, WI, and at special locations across campus, each fellowship is a pop-up community that makes space for creating something totally new.</p>
          <p>You’ll come out for a few overnights and join our design team. Each event brings together an uncommon collection of artists, educators, subject experts, and designers. We’ll design a game around a specific theme, like underwater archaeology or Wisconsin history. As an expert educator, you’ll work side-by-side with people in the field, like underwater archaeologists, biologists, or archivists.</p>

          <h3>A new kind of Workshop</h3>
          <p class="small">Our teacher fellowships are boutique events—not normal PD workshops—that are carefully crafted to inspire you. Each event mixes the best of talks, art, tours, music, games, and design to create a game that will reach kids across the world. We’ll start with a cozy get-together, where we’ll sip drinks and chat. Then we’ll transition into the main event: two days of learning, inspiration, and design work. After the event, you’ll stay connected with a handful of online meet-ups, plus a few ways to involve your kids in design work.</p>
          <p>We offer four fellowships each year. Join us!</p>

      <h4>About the Fellowship</h4>
      <p>14 teacher fellows came out for a unique 2-day event at the Manitowoc Maritime Museum. The teachers met marine archaeologists, game designers, and content producers. First they learned about game design and shipwrecks in the Great Lakes and got inspired by our surroundings. Then they worked to come up with design ideas for a free online game about Great Lakes shipwrecks!</p>

      <p>Eight teacher fellows worked with us to develop a new science game, Lakeland, in collaboration with Victor Zavala at UW’s Scalable Systems Lab. The teachers came on location in Madison, where they met with Victor, toured the campus, and went behind the scenes at Victor’s lab. The teachers helped come up with ideas for Lakeland, did user testing with their students, and gave us input that informed the final version of the game. </p>
