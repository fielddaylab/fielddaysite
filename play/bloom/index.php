      <h2>About the Game</h2>

      <p>In Bloom: The Saga of the <s>Poop</s> Fertilizer Economy, players serve as the director of SAGA: The Sustainable Agricultural Growth Administration. In this role, their goal is to foster support economic growth across five different counties while reducing agricultural runoff and gross subsequent algal blooms. To win, players must develop local trade networks, employ a range of economic and environmental policies, and balance the needs of bickering townsfolk and perspectives of various stakeholders. A key focus of the game is learning about the relationship between agricultural runoff and water quality, while exploring how markets that allow farmers to sell excess manure can lead to cleaner water and farmers stay in business. 
</p>
      <h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
      <p>As the director of SAGA, players can use tax revenues to build roads (and other infrastructure) and enact economic and financial policies. Their objective is to create local trade networks and utilize new technologies to develop a fertilizer market, whereby excess manure can be bought and sold, rather than inefficiently spread on fields. </p>
      <p>Players start by overseeing a single county. As the game unfolds, additional counties are unlocked. In addition to managing the economy within each county, to be successful players must develop strategies for developing trade between counties. 
 </p>
      <p>Players' progress is saved and a player code, which is assigned at the start of the game, can be used to return at a later point. Note that when players return to a game they start at the beginning of the most recently unlocked county. Therefore, it is recommended that if players plan on returning to a saved game that they stop playing after a new county is unlocked, so that they don’t lose any progress they have made.

     <p>Bloom was designed with our amazing partners at UW-Madison’s Scalable Systems Lab and the experts at U.S. Environmental Protections Agency, including Gerardo  Ruiz-Mercado (EPA), David Cole (UW-Madison), and Lauren Knose (EPA). Special thanks to Victor Zavala and his students for sharing their time and expertise. Throughout the design and testing process, we relied on the experience and insights of Field Day teacher fellows and student play-testers from across Wisconsin.</p>
