                    <h2>About the Game</h2>

                    <p>In Legend of the Lost Emerald, kids take on the role of maritime archaeologists exploring shipwrecks on the Great Lakes. Like real archaeologists, players use sonar and GPS coordinates, dive down to take underwater photos, and search for clues in historical artifacts, like letters and ship manifests, to tell the story of each shipwreck. We teamed up with maritime archaeologists at Wisconsin Sea Grant and amazing teacher fellows from across the state of Wisconsin to design a game that works in the classroom and introduces kids to the tools and practices of the field.

Throughout the design and testing process, we relied on the insights and expertise of Field Day teacher fellows from across Wisconsin and beyond.</p>

                    <p>In this story-based game, you'll use a simple version of sonar, take underwater photos with a zoom-and-click mechanic, and connect strings on a corkboard-style evidence board to solve the mystery of each shipwreck. You play as a maritime archeologist whose grandfather captained a freighter that sank on Lake Superior. Throughout the game, youâ€™ll use the practices of real archaeologists to locate shipwrecks, tell the stories of the past, and finally uncover the shipwreck that has haunted your family for generations.

                    <h2 id="teach">Teach with Legend of the Lost Emerald</h2>
                    <p>Teachers can use this game to introduce kids to historical practices and themes from ecology, technology, and Wisconsin history. Students will learn about the role of maritime archaeologists, archivists, historians, and museum curators. The game introduces four different time periods in maritime history, ranging from wooden schooners in the mid-1800s to steel freighters in the 1960s. </p>
