          <h4></h4>
          <p class="small">UW-Madison is ground zero for the field of games and learning. We've been here studying and designing games for over a decade.</p>
          <p class="small"></p>
          <h4>Wondering how Field Day works?</h4>

          <ul>
            <li class="small">Not a private company. We're a research lab at the Wisconsin Center for Education Research.</li>
            <li class="small">Committed to free. Our games are available for everyone. </li>
            <li class="small">Publically funded. We're funded through grants and Broader Impacts projects.</li>
            <li class="small">Subject agnostic. We design games for any subject.

          <h3>Why Games?</h3>
          <h4>Because they work</h4>
          <p class="small">Researchers need to share their work with the public, but it’s hard to communicate super complex topics in a short time frame.</p>
          <p class="small">Games turn complicated topics into fun, hands-on experiences that actually reach people. Our games get millions of plays, with an average playtime of 20 minutes.</p>

        <p class="small">David is a researcher at <a href="https://www.wcer.wisc.edu/" target="_bank">WCER</a>. He's also a programmer, game designer, and passionate advocate for using games to understand and transform how kids learn. David is the co-founder of the PLAY MAKE LEARN conference and the Games and Learning Summit. He serves as a PI on several research projects that explore the following topics in video games: educational data mining, co-design, mixed reality (VR, AR), and location-based games. <p class="small">David created ARIS, an open-source game design platform that has supported the development of thousands of location-based AR projects and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?start=0&q=arisgames.org&hl=en&as_sdt=0,50" target="_blank">hundreds of educational papers.</a> David’s work supports other research, from the <a href="https://fielddaylab.wisc.edu/opengamedata/" target="_blank">Open Game Data</a> project, which shares our game data with educational researchers, to Field Day’s <a href="https://fielddaylab.wisc.edu/fellowships/" target="_blank">teacher fellowship program,</a> which serves as a site to study teachers' professional growth.</p>
        <p class="small">David has been the producer or lead designer for over a dozen award-winning games in topics ranging from engineering, science, and mathematics to history and music. He has been an invited guest or keynote speaker for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, the MacArthur Foundation, the Pearson Foundation, Serious Play, and several smaller workshops and conferences. </p>
        <p class="small">David casts a vision that gets other people excited about joining in the work. He understands the realities of how educational issues affect kids, which allows him to stick unwaveringly to his values. David brings energy and enthusiasm to every project, from research to game design.</p>

    <span>Creative Director</span>
    <div class="wrapper">
      <div class="col-md-12 profile-expanded">
        <p class="small">Sarah is an artist, UX designer, messaging expert, and a fierce advocate for the kids who play our games. From the beginning, she has pushed us to create games that are more than just research instruments. Sarah knows that kids won’t learn anything if they don't care. She makes sure we're designing games that are fun, beautiful, and compelling. 
</p>
        <p class="small">Sarah understands the importance of art in bringing our games to the public. She created our in-house art and communications team, and she ensures that all of our games have an online presence. She also leads game design projects and pitches concepts for new games. Her growing interest in Media Studies and theory influenced by the psychoanalytic tradition is the foundation of her focus on learning games and their role in society. 
</p>
        <p class="small">As an artist, Sarah laughed when her daughter said she was “raised by scientists.” In reality, Sarah’s intuition as a non-scientist gives her crucial insight into what we make. She knows how to ask the right questions and empathize with the people who will end up playing our games.

        <p class="small">Jim is a teacher, researcher, and designer. His work explores the intersection of place, design, and civic engagement. In particular, he’s interested in creating and researching new media-based experiences (e.g., geo-locative games, place-based stories, and field research tools) aimed at connecting youth and adults with people, places, and issues in their community. 
</p>
        <p class="small">As Education Director at Field Day, Jim leads our <a href="https://fielddaylab.wisc.edu/fellowships/" target="_blank">teacher fellowship program.</a> The fellowships are crucial to the successful implementation of our games into schools across the country. As a teacher himself, Jim understands the importance of co-design. He cares about making games that actually work in the classroom, and he’s always looking for the best ways to bring teachers into the design process.

    <h3>Autumn Beauchesne</h3>
    <span>Game Developer and Programmer </span>
    <div class="wrapper">
      <div class="col-md-12 profile-expanded">
        <p class="small">Autumn is a game developer and programmer extraordinaire. She brings expertise in both educational game design and the creation of powerful, easy-to-use development tools. Autumn has been designing games ever since the mid 2000s, when she first began to express her ideas with GameMaker. She’s drawn to how games can be used to explore systems from mechanical and thematic angles. 
</p>
        <p class="small">One of Autumn’s superpowers is her ability to bring other members of the Field Day team—including non-programmers—into the development process. She believes that the best games happen through collaboration, which means everyone on the team needs to be able to contribute without being held back by technical constraints. Autumn cares about developing tools that remove bottlenecks and allow the whole team to create and iterate together. 
</p>
        <p class="small">Autumn was the sole developer and creative force behind Diffission (Filament Games), a fractions game that empowers kids to focus on self-improvement instead of perfection. She was also the sole developer for BeauRoutine, a tool used in nearly all of Filament’s Unity-based games, and the lead engineer for Do I Have a Right?

In addition to being a talented artist, Emily is an amazing researcher with a love of learning. Her detailed concept art, research, and color studies bring depth and richness to our games. Emily studied natural science illustration and animation at the Rhode Island School of Design. </p>
          <p class="small">
            Emily’s passion for natural science illustration began when she drew an endangered species of antelope to share with her art group. The species was so unfamiliar that her group thought she’d made a creature up! That was the spark for Emily’s popular Instagram series, Real and Endangered, in which she shared 125 days of endangered species art with fun facts and conservation status for each animal. Emily believes that education is a powerful, underutilized aspect of conservation. She uses art as a tool to help people connect with nature, because, in her words, when you learn about something, you start to care about it. <br />

            As a game designer at Field Day, Bobby brings a rich depth of experience in educational game design and development. When he was a kid, Bobby noticed his classmates’ halfhearted response to a programming environment that he loved working in. As a designer, he’s drawn to the challenge of figuring out why those kids weren’t interested, and how he can design with them in mind. Bobby uses his expertise to create games not just for the kids (and adults) who are already excited about learning, but for the ones who start out reluctant or uninterested. In addition to front-end design, he has worked closely with the writing and art teams at Field Day, developing story concepts and working with artists to create game art that is beautiful and cohesive.
          </p>
          <p class="small">
            Bobby was a lead game designer at a casual games studio before starting his own studio, Important Little Games. He was the lead designer and programmer for <a href="https://importantlittlegames.itch.io/codemancer-ch-1" target="_blank">Codemancer</a>, a fantasy game that teaches programming for kids ages 6 through 12. Bobby wears a lot of hats and looks good in all of them. His background includes game design and programming—and also screenwriting, creative direction, and toy design, plus an educational background in film, TV production, math, and computer science. He can always be counted on for a good pun.

He worked extensively on game mechanic development for Legend of the Lost Emerald, and continues to build prototypes and implement content for many of our games, as well as support and contribute to the writing team. He has always been drawn to doing work that benefits people, and he considered psychiatry and writing before discovering game design and its rich potential for learning.</p>

            Levi grew up traveling the world—he has lived in Washington, Hawaii, Qatar, and Germany before moving to the Midwest to study at UW-Madison. In addition to computer science and game design, he studied Finnish—both because he loves the language, and because he’s interested in the technology and game design opportunities in Finland. He has worked on his own game design projects outside of Field Day and joined in game jams with other Field Day interns.
