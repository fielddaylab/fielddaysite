          <h2>Our Approach</h2>
          <div class="pub-wrap">
            <p class="small">We perform research at the intersection of theories of interactive media and situated and sociocultural learning. Our research addresses Mobile Mixed Reality, Games and Learning, and Learning Through Making.</p>
            <p class="small">Our team includes a professional design/production studio, which creates games and apps used by over a million users yearly. This affords us a unique opportunity to explore the ways in which large numbers of users create fine-grained data that inform our understanding of how to assess, design and theorize about how learning takes occurs. </p>
            <p class="small">In the course of our own design research, we have produced tools that allow researchers, educators, and designers broadly (including kids!) to create their own interactive media. This has led to collaborations and inspiration beyond our wildest dreams! Therefore, we are committed to sharing and supporting our technology freely and openly, including community-based online support.</p>
            <p class="small">If you are interested in exploring Augmented and Mixed Reality check out <a href="/make/aris">Aris</a> If you are investigating Digital Field Work and Citizen Science, check out <a target="_blank" href="http://siftr.org">Siftr</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="https://nomenproject.org/" target="_blank">Nomen Project</a></p>
            <p class="small">Please share your research with us so that this community can continue to grow and benefit from our collective work. Also, if you are planning a research project that will be leveraging our technologies and tools, <a href="/work">contact us,</a> We would love to collaborate! </p>
