We can conduct all the design, testing and evaluation with you either in person or remotely.</p>

                  <p class="small">First, we give our games and apps for free to the public, removing the cost barrier for play. Second, we don’t require logins for players, which allows schools to use our games. Third, we network with public schools, public television, media outlets and large online distributors.  <a class="small" href="https://datastudio.google.com/open/0B3XkHYR1Or_fMVdxOVZ6M3I2TEE" target="_blank">See live data from the Yard Games</a></p>

                  <p class="small">We provide real-time analytics so you can see  who, how long and when people play your game or app. We also use these games as instruments to measure and understand learning for our own research. If the project budget allows, we will use this data as part of a larger research and evaluation protocol to understand what and how our audience is learning. This analysis leads to design revisions, academic publications and research grant proposals.</p>

          <h3>We are a Research Lab</h3>
          <p class="small">Field Day is an education media research lab within the Wisconsin Center for Education Research at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. Our work lies at the intersection of interactive media and theories of situated and sociocultural learning. In that pursuit, we create new technologies such as augmented and virtual reality, video games, coding platforms and mobile apps that act as research platforms to understand how people learn.</p>

          <h3>What Does a Game Cost?</h3>
          <p class="small">Our games vary widely in cost. They can take anywhere from a few months to several years to produce. Many labs don’t have this kind of funding, but we have a plan. We partner with you to write the grants that will pay for the project. We start by looking for seed funds available through your organization to develop a game concept. Next we use this concept, complete with sample art and clearly articulated goals, to write public engagement and outreach grants or to write the Broader Impacts or Public Outreach section of your research grant.</p>
